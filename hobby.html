                            Music is one of my passion's. Playing guitar for almost 30 years right now and still enjoying it like e newbie. My favourite styles are rock, blues & jazz but also enjoy some funky. Never had a chance to play with a band, but as my childrens are playing several instruments as well, home is filled with music. Will never give this one up.

                            I was always interested in computers. First one was Atari 800XL, mostly for games but after few months just wanted see if there is another usage for it so I've started to learn Basic programming language. Only disadvantage was saving the programs on music cassette, yes indeed there were no hard drives nor USB sticks, in fact there was no USB slot.

                            <p class="card-text">Not mentionning short time I was trying myself with Pascal & Delphi, 4 years ago, as my son received embed system for his birthday, I've found it very interesting so returned to my programming dreams. For now I know basics, as I don't consider myself as pro, of several programming languages as: C, C++, python, Swift, JavaScript, css, html. Hope to know every of them more in details but as well learn others - WhyNot!

                            Another one is sport, skiing especially. At school I've played basketball & volleyball with our teams. Always try to spend my free time actively. Since I learn how to ski I consider this as best sport ever. Whoever didn't try till now - should !
